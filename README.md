## About data from GRID

You can use GRID data anywhere in the project.
`const grid = useGrid()`

The data "grid" has 2 properties,

- **events**: Originally an allay [] as the "events" property in each record from the websocket server. If there are 2 event records in a "events" property of a single websocket message, we make 2 events record.
- **state**: We extract "seriesState" property from event record above, but only keeps the latest status. And we added useful pre-calculated properties, "ongoingGame" and "timer".

### usage

```javascript
const grid = useGrid();
const events = grid.events;
const state = grid.state;

const timerSeconds = state.timer.time; // You can use a extended property that I made.
const game = events[0].seriesState.ongoingGame; // seriesState is also extended!
```

### pre-calculated properties

- ongoingGame
  If game is already started, that entire game information is here.
- timer
  If game is already started, clock is ticking. I simply put the clock to this object so that you can use them easily.
